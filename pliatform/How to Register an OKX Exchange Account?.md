## 3. Log in to the App to Claim Your Blind Box

New users can log in to the OKX app to claim a blind box with cryptocurrency rewards worth up to $60,000. Each blind box contains cryptocurrency such as BTC, ETH, OKB, DOGE, FIL, SHIB, or DOT, with a minimum value of 1 USDT. The platform strictly prohibits creating multiple accounts to claim rewards.

### How to Download the OKX App:

After registering, youâ€™ll be redirected to the app download page.  

- **Android Users:** Install the app directly. If you see a risk warning, you can ignore it. For some phones (e.g., Huawei), disable **Pure Mode** if necessary.  
- **iOS Users:** If your Apple ID is set to the China region, you cannot install the OKX app. Use an overseas Apple ID instead. Learn more in the guide: [How to Install Exchange Apps on iPhone](https://www.zhinitaimei.com/50/).

Once the app is installed, log in using your registered account to open your blind box.

## 4. Identity Verification

After logging into the OKX app, youâ€™ll see the option for **Identity Verification** in the top-left corner. Follow the prompts to complete the verification process.  

Identity verification levels include:  
- **Basic Verification**  
- **Advanced Verification**  
- **Video Verification**  

Completing at least **Advanced Verification** is recommended.

### Is Identity Verification Necessary?

Identity verification is not mandatory. However, without it, you cannot use fiat currency to purchase crypto. Spot and futures trading remain unrestricted.

## 5. Security Settings

To enhance the security of your account, go to the **Security Settings** section in the OKX app (top-left menu).

### Recommended Security Measures:

1. Set up a **Phishing Code** to avoid fake emails or websites.  
2. Bind your **email** and **phone number**.  
3. Enable **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**  
   - 2FA generates dynamic passwords that refresh every 60 seconds, providing an added layer of security.  

#### For iOS Users:
Download **Google Authenticator** from the App Store.

#### For Android Users:
Since many domestic phones lack Google Play, you can use Binanceâ€™s authenticator or download a Google Authenticator APK file (caution is advised due to security concerns).
