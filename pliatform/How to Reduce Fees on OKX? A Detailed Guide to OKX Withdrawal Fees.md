## Understanding OKX Contract Fees

OKX perpetual contract fees range between **0.015% and 0.02% for maker orders** and **0.03% and 0.05% for taker orders**. These fees are charged at 10:00 AM and 10:00 PM UTC every 12 hours, aligning with contract settlement times. Users only incur funding fees when holding positions during these times.

Hereâ€™s how funding fees are calculated:  
**Funding Fee (in USD) = Contract Size Ã— Number of Contracts Ã— Funding Rate**

- If the funding rate is positive, long position holders pay short position holders.  
- If the funding rate is negative, short position holders pay long position holders.

**Example:**  
If a user buys two BTC contracts at $500 USD/BTC settlement price and sells one at $1,000 USD/BTC, the realized profit is:  
`(100 / 500 â€“ 100 / 1000) * 1 = 0.1 BTC`

For unrealized profits or losses, they are calculated based on the **settlement price** and the **latest market price**.

## OKX Fee Structure for Users

OKX uses a **VIP system** to determine transaction fees, dividing users into regular and professional tiers based on trading volume or asset holdings. Higher VIP levels result in lower fees. The platform evaluates:

1. **30-day trading volume (USD)**  
2. **Snapshot of asset holdings at midnight (USD)**  

For instance:  
- If a user has a 30-day trading volume of $20M (VIP 2) and assets worth $5M (VIP 4), their fee tier will be set at VIP 4.

### OKX Fee Chart

Fees are influenced by user tier and OKB (OKXâ€™s native token) holdings. Users can also use OKB tokens to offset transaction fees.

## OKB: The Key to Lower Fees on OKX

OKB, the platform token of OKX, plays a significant role in reducing fees. OKB follows a deflationary model, with the platform buying back and burning tokens quarterly using 30% of trading fee revenue. In 2020, OKX destroyed 700 million uncirculated OKB tokens, making it the worldâ€™s first fully circulating platform token.
