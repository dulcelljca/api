## What is OKX DEX?

**OKX DEX** is a decentralized exchange built on **OKC**, the blockchain developed by OKX. OKC is an open-source public blockchain designed for large-scale commercial applications. As the first application on OKC, OKX DEX offers a global, decentralized trading platform with the following features:

- **Security**: Utilizing the [secp256k1 elliptic curve algorithm](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2018/08/14/bitcoin-elliptic-curves/), OKX DEX ensures a highly secure trading environment.
- **Noncustodial**: Users retain full access and control over their assets and wallets.
- **Order Matching**: Employing a call auction mechanism, OKX DEX ensures a single traded price for each trading pair within a block.

By leveraging OKC, OKX DEX provides a more seamless trading experience and lower trading fees compared to public blockchains like Ethereum. This infrastructure is tailored for trading DApps and DEXs, reducing costs for developers and users alike.
