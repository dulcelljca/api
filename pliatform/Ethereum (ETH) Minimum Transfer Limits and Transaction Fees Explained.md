## Recent Changes in ETH Transaction Fees

Major cryptocurrency platforms like **OKX** and others periodically adjust their fee structures based on market conditions. For example, a recent update standardized transaction fees across various trading pairs to **0.2%**.

Ethereum transaction fees, or **gas fees**, are essential for processing transactions and running smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The formula to calculate gas fees is:

```plaintext
Transaction Fee (TxFee) = Actual Gas Used Ã— Gas Price
```

For instance, if your transaction consumes 50 gas units and the gas price is 2 Gwei, your total fee is **50 Ã— 2 = 100 Gwei**.

## What Are Ethereum Smart Contracts?

Ethereumâ€™s smart contracts are self-executing contracts where the terms of the agreement are directly written into code. These smart contracts enable decentralized applications and manage digital assets like **ETH, tokens, and other cryptocurrencies** without intermediaries. 

Key features of Ethereum smart contracts include:

- **High flexibility**: Ethereum supports various programming languages, giving developers the freedom to write complex contracts.
- **Sandbox mechanism**: Contracts are isolated from external interactions, limiting permissions and protecting the blockchain's integrity.

Smart contracts power a wide range of use cases, such as **digital currency exchanges, asset management, and decentralized finance (DeFi)** applications.

## How to Transfer and Receive ETH Using Wallets

### Using imToken Wallet for Transactions

The **imToken wallet** is a popular tool for managing Ethereum transactions. Hereâ€™s how to use it:

3. Select **Send** to initiate a transfer:
   - Enter the recipient's address and the transfer amount.
   - Confirm the transaction by entering your password.

4. For receiving ETH:
   - Tap **Receive** to generate a wallet address or QR code.
   - Share the address or QR code with the sender.

### Tips for Efficient Transactions
