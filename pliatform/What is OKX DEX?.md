## 1. Understanding Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)

### 1.1 Whatâ€™s a DEX?

A decentralized exchange (DEX) is a peer-to-peer platform where tokens are traded directly between crypto traders without intermediaries like banks or brokers. These trades are facilitated through **smart contracts** and are settled on the blockchain.

### 1.2 Types of DEXs and How They Work

There are three primary types of DEXs:

1. **Order Book DEXs** (on-chain and off-chain):  
   Similar to CEXs, this model uses an order book to compile buy and sell orders and matches them to complete trades.

2. **Automated Market Makers (AMMs):**  
   AMMs leverage smart contracts and liquidity pools funded by users from the community. These investors earn a share of the trading fees.

3. **DEX Aggregators:**  
   These provide a one-stop hub by consolidating prices from multiple DEXs, offering users the best prices with minimal slippage.

### 1.3 Why Trade on DEXs?

- **Self-Custody:** Full control over your tokensâ€”assets are directly managed via your wallet.
- **Security:** Tokens are stored in your wallet, reducing risks associated with exchange hacks.
- **Lower Fees:** Many DEXs charge minimal to no platform fees, allowing traders to keep more profits.
- **Wide Token Variety:** New tokens can be minted and listed on DEXs, creating a large array of trading options.

### 1.4 Downsides of Using DEXs

While DEXs have significant advantages, there are challenges:

- **Riskier Tokens:** Some tokens may be scams, such as rug pulls.  
- **Liquidity Issues:** Liquidity depends on community-provided pools, which can be limited.  
- **On/Off Ramps:** Most DEXs donâ€™t support fiat-to-crypto exchanges.  
- **Complex Interfaces:** DEX platforms may be less intuitive for beginners, requiring extra research.
