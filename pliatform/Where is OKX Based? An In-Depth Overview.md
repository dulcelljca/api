## Challenges and Controversies

OKX initially operated from Beijing but withdrew from the Chinese mainland in October 2021 due to stringent regulatory restrictions. Despite its official exit, reports suggest that third-party contractors continue to support OKX operations from China.

- **Fake Trading Volume**: In 2018, a report alleged that up to 93% of OKXâ€™s trading volume was fabricated.  
- **Technical Issues and Outages**: The "9.5 Flash Crash" in 2018 caused platform downtime, leading to significant investor losses.  
- **Legal Disputes**: A notable conflict arose in 2019 when Yang Yongxing claimed to have lost 8 billion RMB due to account freezing.  
- **Temporary Withdrawal Suspension**: In October 2020, OKX paused withdrawals when a key private key holder cooperated with an investigation. Withdrawals were later resumed after the situation stabilized.
